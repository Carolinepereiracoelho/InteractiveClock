# InteractiveClock
This is an interactive clock that shows a picture according to the time of the day. So, If it's in the morning, afternoon or night, we'll show you a picture according to it. 
It was made by me whose purpose is to learn more about DOM, events, elements, and conditions in JavaScript.
